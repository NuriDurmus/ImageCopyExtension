# Image Copy & Converter Extension

A Chrome extension — upload clipboard images and PDFs to file input fields, convert formats, pick and copy images from any webpage, and capture colors from your screen.

---

## Features

### Clipboard → File Input Upload (Core Feature)

- **Auto-detection**: The file input you click is automatically captured
- **Unified selection modal**: A "Choose File" modal appears with available options:
  - 📄 **Selected PDF** card (if any) — shows the PDF name
  - 🖼️ **Clipboard image** card (if any) — small preview, size and format info
  - 📁 **Choose from computer** button (native dialog)
  - Cancel
- **Smart behavior**: If neither a PDF nor an image is available, the native file dialog opens directly
- **Post-upload cleanup**: After the file is injected into the input, clipboard and PDF selection are automatically cleared — the same content won't be suggested again

### PDF Selection & Upload

- **Select PDF links on any page**: Click any PDF link on the page using PDF Picker mode to select it
- **Persistent storage**: The selected PDF is saved to `chrome.storage.local` and remembered even after page refresh
- **CORS bypass**: PDFs are fetched via the background service worker, avoiding CORS errors
- **Upload progress UI**: A live progress panel shows connection state, download/upload phases, percent, and MB progress during PDF injection
- **Large file performance improvements**: Optimized transfer path (`ArrayBuffer`/typed-array handling, reduced conversion overhead) significantly lowers freezes for larger PDFs
- **Cross-origin stability**: Cross-origin PDF URLs automatically use background fetch mode for more reliable uploads
- **Smart filename**: Priority order is `download` attribute → URL path → link text; double `.pdf` extensions and unnecessary " PDF" suffixes are cleaned automatically
- **Popup preview**: When the popup opens, the selected PDF's name is shown and can be downloaded directly

### Format Conversion

- **Source formats**: PNG, JPEG, WebP, BMP, GIF, SVG
- **Target formats**: PNG, JPEG, WebP, BMP, GIF
- **Quality control**: 1–100% adjustment for JPEG/WebP
- **SVG note**: SVG → raster conversion is supported; raster → SVG auto-vectorization is not. If no explicit rule exists for SVG, the SVG file is uploaded as-is

### Image Editor

- **Modal editor**: Open the editor before uploading a clipboard image
- **Direct editing from popup**: Launch the editor without a file input using the "Edit Image" button
- **Tools**: Resize (presets + custom), crop with draggable handles, rotate, flip, zoom, undo (Ctrl+Z, 20 steps)
- **Paste with Ctrl+V**: While the editor is open, paste a new image from clipboard with Ctrl+V
- **Exit options**: Copy 📋 / Download ⬇️ / Use edited image ✓
- **Format + quality**: PNG/JPEG/WebP and quality slider are always available

### Popup Quick Download

- **Header download icon**: The `⬇️` icon is active when supported content exists in the clipboard
- **Format badge**: Shows the detected format such as `SVG`, `PNG`, `JPG`, etc.
- **PDF priority**: If a PDF is selected, it is shown as the content to download
- **SVG priority**: If the clipboard contains SVG, it is saved as `.svg`

### Visual Image Picker

- **Shortcut activation**: Default `Ctrl+Alt+S` (customizable)
- **Visual highlight**: Images are highlighted with a blue outline as you hover
- **Broad detection**: Detects `<img>`, inline `<svg>`, and CSS `background-image` elements
- **Click to copy**: Clicking a highlighted image copies it to the clipboard
- **Exit**: Large X button or `Escape`

### Image Replace Mode

- **Shortcut activation**: Customizable (e.g. `Ctrl+Alt+R`)
- **Replace with clipboard image**: Click any image on the page to replace it with clipboard content
- **Source-only change**: No HTML attributes, classes, or styles are affected other than `src`, `srcset`, or `background-image`
- **Multiple replacements**: Replace several images in a single session
- **Exit with ESC**: End the mode with `Escape` or the X button

### Color Picker

- **Shortcut activation**: Customizable (e.g. `Ctrl+Alt+C`)
- **EyeDropper API**: System-wide color picking on modern browsers (including outside the browser)
- **Canvas-based fallback**: Used automatically when EyeDropper is not supported or on PDFs
- **Real-time preview**: HEX + RGB values update live as you move the mouse
- **Auto-copy**: The picked color code is automatically copied to the clipboard
- **PDF compatible**: Works on PDF documents open in the browser
- **Exit with ESC**: `Escape` or the X button
